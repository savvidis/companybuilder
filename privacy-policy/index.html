					<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
			<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">Angel Ventures, LLC (“Angel Ventures”, “we”, “us” or “our”) respects your concerns about privacy.  This Privacy Policy describes the types of personal information we collect, how we use (and don’t use!) such information and with whom we share it.  We also describe, among other things, the measures we take to protect the security of such information and how you can contact us about our privacy practices.  We recognize that we must maintain and use your personal information responsibly.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">When we refer to “personal information”, we mean information by which you or the device you are using to connect to the Internet can be identified.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any personal information that our business partners share with us or that we share with our business partners.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications that you elect to access through the Service or to individuals that we do not manage or employ. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those third party services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of such third party services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any third party services you access.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Information We Collect</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">We may obtain personal information about you from various sources, including the Service and our other websites, mobile applications, when you call or email us or communicate with us through social media, or when you participate in events or other promotions.  We also may obtain information about you from our business partners and other third parties.  Any personal information you provide to us is maintained on secure servers and our internal systems.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on the Service.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">The types of personal information we may obtain include:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Your contact information (such as name, Twitter handle, postal and email address);</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Username and password for the account you may establish on the Service;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Demographic information (such as age, date of birth and gender);</p>

</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Information you provide by interacting with us through social media, including photographs;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Location information, such as the real­time geographic location of the device on which you install our mobile applications (note:  when you use one of our applications on your mobile device you may be able to choose not to share your geo­location details with us by adjusting the device’s location services settings.  For instructions on changing the relevant settings, please contact your service provider or device manufacturer);</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Your search queries conducted on the Service;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">A confirmation when you open an email from us; and</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Other details that you may submit to us or that may be included in the information provided to us by third parties.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">In addition, we may use “cookies,” “device identifiers” or similar types of technology (e.g., pixels tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, and local storage) to collect information about your use of the Service.  We may use this information to help us enhance the efficiency and usefulness of the Service, to customize your visit to the Service, and for other purposes to make your visit more convenient or to enable us to enhance the Service.  For your information, “cookies” are files that are stored on your computer’s hard drive by a website, and “device identifiers” are files that are stored on your mobile device that identify your device.  Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain personal information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are. As noted, however, we do use cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Service and may associate that information with your account if you have one. In addition, we may use third parties to provide products and services to you through the Service.  These third parties may employ cookies, device identifiers, or similar technologies.  Note:  most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies.  Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the Service’s features.  In addition, disabling cookies may cancel opt­outs that rely on cookies, such as targeted advertising opt­outs.  Finally, your mobile device may provide you with information and choices on what data is shared with us.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">When you visit the Service, we may automatically collect certain non­identifying information about you, such as the computer operating system or mobile device that you use to access the Service, your Internet Protocol address, your browser type and settings, your bandwidth speed and information about the software programs that are installed on your computer, the date and time that you access the Service, the web pages you were visiting immediately before and after you came to the Service, the domain name of the website from which you linked to the Service, search terms that visitors use to reach the Service, information on actions taken on the Service (such as page views and site navigation patterns) and links and advertisements that you click on within the Service and other technical information that assists us in improving our services.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">We also may use third­party website analytics tools that collect information about visitor traffic on the Service.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we may use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”), and the Google Analytics tracking code implemented by us supports Display Advertising and its features (e.g., Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting).  We will not facilitate the merging of personally­identifiable information with non­personally identifiable information previously collected from such Display Advertising features unless you have first been provided with abundant notice of and given us your prior affirmative (i.e. opt­in) consent to, that merger.  We and third­party vendors, including Google, use first­party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third­party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize and serve ads based on your past visits to the Service.  For example, we may use such analytics to (i) display content specific advertisements to visitors that have previously visited the Service when those visitors go to other websites (e.g., Google may show ads relating to the Service to those visitors across the Internet) and (ii) help us determine how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to the Service.  You can opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display ads using the Google Ads Preferences Manager.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">We may collect statistical information about how users collectively, use the Service. Some of this information is derived from personal information. This statistical information is not personal information and cannot be tied back to you, your account or your web browser</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Information We Share</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">We do not disclose personal information about you, except as expressly described in this Privacy Policy.  For the sake of emphasis, Angel Ventures will never rent or sell your personal information.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">We may share the personal information we collect with our parent, affiliate and subsidiary companies, ad network vendors and their participants (as discussed above), and other third parties for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including to communicate with you about products and services, offers, events and promotions that we believe may be of interest to you.  We also may disclose your personal information to our vendors, subcontractors, and business partners, and other third parties who provide services to us.  However, they are only permitted to access your information in connection with performing such services and are not authorized by us to use the information for their own benefit.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Access and Correction</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">You may obtain a copy of certain personal information we maintain about you or update or correct inaccuracies in that information using the online account you may establish on the Service.  In addition, if you believe other personal information we maintain about you is inaccurate, you may request that we correct or amend the information by contacting us as indicated in the “How to Contact Us” section of this Privacy Policy.  If we deny an access request, we will notify you of the reasons for the denial.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Links to Other Websites; Social Media</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">To enhance your experience, the Service may include links to other, unaffiliated sites.  Those websites will have their own privacy policies that you may wish to review.  We have no responsibility for such linked websites or any use of those sites or those sites’ privacy practices.  The Service may contain links to our presence on various social media platforms.  As we do not operate or control such platforms, this Privacy Policy and our User Agreement do not apply to your use of such platforms.  In addition, you should be aware that personal information which you voluntarily include and transmit online in a publicly accessible blog, social network or other social media platform may be viewed and used by others.  We are unable to control such uses of your personal information, and by using such services you assume the risk that the personal information provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to assist us in protecting the personal information we collect against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">While we implement these security measures on the Service, please note that 100% security is not always possible.  We cannot guarantee that the security measures we have in place to safeguard personal information will never be defeated or fail, or that those measures will always be sufficient or effective.  You play a role in protecting your information as well.  Because your password permits access to your personal information, please keep your password secret and do not disclose it to others.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">What Choices Do I Have Regarding My Personal Information?</p>
